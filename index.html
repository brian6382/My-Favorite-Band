They are loving people and caring.The band was formed in 2005 as an a cappella group by Baraza, Chimano and Savara,
who had met at the Upper Hill High School and performed in Voices in the Light, a music group at the school.[2][3] 
They then met guitarist Otieno, who attended Strathmore School, at the Alliance française in Nairobi, where they
would frequent and decided to form Sauti (Swahili for "sound") and immediately wrote their first song, "Mafunzo 
ya Dunia" (Literally: lessons of the world), which would later feature in their debut studio album Mwanzo.[5] 
The band later added the Spanish word "Sol" (sun) to their name and formed Sauti Sol (supposed to mean "voices 
in the sun").[11] In 2006, the band participated in the Spotlight on Kenyan Music competition, hosted by the 
Alliance française in Nairobi. They were included in the album compilation recording and later got signed to 
Penya Records.[12] The four members all completed their university education in Kenya. Baraza studied journalism at 
the United States International University, while Savara studied commerce and finance at Africa Nazarene University.
Chimano studied journalism at the University of Nairobi, while Otieno studied actuarial science at the Jomo Kenyatta 
 University of Agriculture and Technology.[11]
Sauti Sol released their debut studio album Mwanzo on 4 August 2009, via their record label Penya Records,
to critical acclaim, and followed up with their second studio album Sol Filosofia two years later. 
The music video for the album's second single, "Coming Home", earned them the Best Music Video award 
at the 2011 Kisima Music Awards, with the group itself also winning the Best Fusion Artist/Group of the Year award.[13]
